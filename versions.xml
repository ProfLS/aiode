    <feature title="Introduction of private bots with YouTube bot detection circumvention for supporters">[Supporters](https://ko-fi.com/R5R0XAC5J) can now invite a private instance of aiode separate from the public bot using the new invite command. Those bots feature additional measures to circumvent YouTube bot detection, as well as traditional text commands with custom prefixes and access to the bot's scripting sandbox. Private bots are limited to 100 servers each with more bots being created on demand, which allows them to stay under YouTube's radar and enables Discord features that would otherwise require special privileged for large bots. Private bots are separate instances of the bot using a separate user account each, however, they are connected to the same database so data (playlists etc.) is shared.</feature>
    <feature title="Spotify to SoundCloud redirection">If the Spotify track is not found on [filebroker](https://filebroker.io/) and the YouTube track fails to load due to YouTube bot detection, the bot now also attempts to find the track on SoundCloud. If you didn't know, YouTube is currently central to aiode because it is also used to look up and play Spotify tracks from, filebroker and SoundCloud reduce the reliance on YouTube.</feature>
    <feature title="filebroker.io integration improvements">Various fixes and improvements for [filebroker](https://filebroker.io/register) integration.</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="2.3">
    <feature title="filebroker.io integration">As an alternative to YouTube, aiode now features integration with [filebroker](https://filebroker.io/register). This includes searching for content on filebroker using the $filebroker argument, pasting URLs for filebroker posts and collections, as well as looking up Spotify tracks. If you didn't know, YouTube is currently central to aiode because it is also used to look up and play Spotify tracks from. With this update, aiode will also use filebroker as a source if the requested Spotify track is available. This enables a community driven workaround for YouTube continuously working to shut down bots. Please consider [supporting](https://ko-fi.com/R5R0XAC5J) the project and start sharing content with the community. All aiode community members get access to content shared with the community as well as a 1GB upload quota, supporters get an extra 32GB as well as other bonuses. Claim access through the [aiode discord](https://discord.gg/gdc25AG).</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="2.2.1">
    <feature title="Upcoming: filebroker.io integration">With the uncertainty of the future of YouTube integration, aiode is moving to implement support for the new [filebroker](https://filebroker.io/register) project as a community driven open source alternative. If you didn't know, YouTube is currently central to aiode because it is also used to look up and play Spotify tracks from. In the future, aiode will also use filebroker for this purpose, but this does rely on the community to share content. Please consider [supporting](https://ko-fi.com/R5R0XAC5J) the project and start sharing content with the community. All aiode community members get access to content shared with the community as well as a 1GB upload quota, supporters get an extra 32GB as well as other bonuses. Claim access through the [aiode discord](https://discord.gg/gdc25AG).</feature>
    <feature title="Scripting sandbox access to aiode supporters">Users who support the bot through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/R5R0XAC5J) get access to the scripting sandbox, enabling users to create custom commands as well as modify behaviour of existing commands. For example, you could create a script that joins your channel and starts playing automatically when you join a voice channel, a command that ensures shuffle is enabled before playing or skips the queue to a track with a specific name and much more. To claim access to this feature you must be a member of the [aiode discord](https://discord.gg/gdc25AG). Make sure to connect your Ko-fi account with discord to get the supporters role automatically.</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="2.2">
    <feature title="Queue insertion and removal">Added the $insert and $remove arguments to the queue command to remove the tracks at the given index range from the queue or insert tracks at the given position. The $insert argument inserts the tracks right after the current track by default (or if the $next argument is used), you can add the $at argument to insert the tracks at any position relative to the current position in the queue (e.g. `queue $insert $at=2 numb` inserts the track 'numb' after the next track in the queue).</feature>
    <feature title="auto queue">Added the 'auto queue' guild property to control the behaviour of the bot when using the play command while already playing something else. This is accessible via the property command with the following options: 'queue next' -&gt; insert the tracks into the queue after the current track, this is now the default / 'queue last' -&gt; append the tracks to the end of the queue / 'off' -&gt; enables the original behaviour the play command replaces the current queue</feature>
    <feature title="New widget interactions">Using Discord's button interaction system rather than reactions for widgets, enabling them to be displayed a lot faster (instead of adding reactions one by one) and adding multiple rows. The queue widget has been extended with volume controls.</feature>
    <feature title="Default volume property">The default volume of 100 can now be changed using the 'default volume' property of the property command.</feature>
    <feature title="Improved charts command">The charts command has been overhauled, much improving performance and adding user specific charts. Global charts are now only refreshed once per day instead of on demand.</feature>
    <feature title="Improved performance">Performance of many database queries has been improved significantly with additional indexes.</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="2.1">
    <feature title="Slash command migration">As message content is now becoming a privileged intent, bots can only read message content when mentioned directly. This means prefixes will no longer work, at least until the bot is authorized for the intent. Using commands now only works via slash commands or when mentioning the bot as a prefix (e.g. `@aiode play numb`).</feature>
    <feature title="Queue system rework">The queue system received a substantial backend rework, enabling support for future features, such as inserting / removing items everywhere in the queue.</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="2.0">
    <feature title="Scripting sandbox">Implement groovy script command sandbox.</feature>
    <feature title="Backend rework">Rework codebase with spring boot and gradle.</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="1.6.LTS.4">
    <feature title="YouTube API quota usage adjustments">Tired of botify reaching the YouTube API quota limit and breaking all YouTube requests? So am I. Botify now calculates the approximate quota usage and stops using the YouTube API wherever possible in exchange for parsing the html response of YouTube pages using lavaplayer when the quota gets low.</feature>
    <feature title="Embed message formatting adjustments">Adjusted the layout of some embed messages to the new discord update.</feature>
    <feature title="Enabled JDA sharding">Added JDA sharding. This was originally intended as a feature for botify 2 but botify is going to reach 2500 guilds, the maximum number of guilds per WebSocket, before then.</feature>
  </version>
  <version version="1.6.LTS">
    <feature>this long-term-support version of botify 1.6 marks the end of development for botify 1 while development shifts to botify 2 featuring a new web client and improved queue management</feature>
